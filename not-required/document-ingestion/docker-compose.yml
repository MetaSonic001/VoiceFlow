# NOTE: This project delegates metadata storage to the backend/Postgres service.
# Do not run a second Postgres here. Configure your environment to point at the
# backend Postgres (host: localhost, port: 5433 by default) or set BACKEND_DATABASE_URL
# in your environment to the backend's DATABASE_URL.

services: {}
  # backend Postgres at host port 5433 (container still listens on 5432 internally).

## FastAPI Backend Requirements

Your FastAPI backend should implement these exact endpoints with the documented request/response formats. The frontend is fully integrated and will work immediately once you:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` in your environment
2. Implement the documented endpoints in your FastAPI app
3. Ensure CORS is configured for your frontend domain
4. Return the exact response formats documented in the TypeScript interfaces

## CrewAI Integration Points

The frontend expects your CrewAI agents to:
1. Process uploaded documents and create knowledge embeddings
2. Handle conversation messages and return responses with optional chunk information
3. Provide analytics data from conversation logs
4. Support real-time updates via WebSocket for live monitoring

All conversation endpoints include session management to maintain context across the CrewAI agent interactions.
